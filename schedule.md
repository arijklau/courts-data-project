 ** By March 4, we should have the virginia court open data service fully replicated; this can serve as the first MVP check point

 *** By March 25 we should have two states fully connected on the website and this is our second MVP checkpoint

 NOTE: This is the development schedule and does not include the auditing of data aggregation techniques we are using. We will begin that auditing process after March 4 when we have our first MVP.
