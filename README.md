# Courts Data Project

The court data project is the product of a partnership between the CommPAS Lab at the Batten School (through Michele Claibourn), the UVA Library (through Michele Claibourn), the Legal Data Lab at UVA Law School (through Jon Ashley), and the Computer Science Department (through Jack Davidson and the students developing the project).

## Background

This is an open source project to scrape and publish data from US courts. This information is already publicly available and when organized well, can lead to important reporting and holding the government accountable. We recognize the importantance of preserving as much anonymity as possible in this work and are developing it with the public's interest at mind. In particular, we are focusing on marginalized communities and ensuring that we do not create a digital system that exploits or overly surveils them.

## Inspiration

This project is inspired by the wonderful work of [Ben Schoenfeld](https://github.com/bschoenfeld) who created the original project to scrape and organize the Virginia courts dataset. We plan on building on his vision by improving on his initial implementation and expanding it to include the entire US court system.

## Licensing

We have not determined which license we want to use yet, but eventually plan on releasing the code with a license. We want to develop an ethical open source license that only allows the work to be re-used and built upon in the public interest. Until we release it with a license, please do not re-use or re-publish the code without expicit permission from a contributor. To get permission, feel free to email [Rohit](mailto::rohit.musti.rm@gmail.com).
